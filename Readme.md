  The butter chicken is my favourite because it is not having bones . And 
its gravy is also sweet not spicy and the gravy is mouth wattering.

 Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, you may notice that Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani â€” chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala.

Prepared in a buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. Most restaurants are known to add in copious amounts of butter, which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick of grease.
